In this section we will get your lab environment ready to do:

1. **Access Cloud9** - We'll start off accessing your development environment in AWS Cloud9, a web-based Integrate Development Environment

2. **Connect MVISION Cloud to AWS** - Next we will connect MVISION Cloud to your AWS environment to provide visibility and control over IaaS resources and configuration.

#### Let's get started with the lab in the next section!
