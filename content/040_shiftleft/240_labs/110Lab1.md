## Easy difficulty
We're going to start with the template named "fixme_easy_cloudformation.json"

1. Log into your Jenkins instance.

2. From the home screen, enter the project named "1_ConfigAudit_Easy" and click the "Build Now" button.  This will cause Jenkins to attempt to build the "fixme_easy_cloudformation.json" file in your AWS CodeCommit repo.

3. Observe the project's build progress in the build window:

  ![Build Progress](/images/mfe/buildprogress.png?classes=border,shadow)
4.  The build will fail.  Let's click the number next to the red dot of the recent build to explore why:

  ![Click Failed Build](/images/mfe/clickfailedbuild.png?classes=border,shadow)
  
5.  From the build status screen, click "Console Output":

  ![Click Console Output](/images/mfe/project1clickconsoleoutput.png?classes=border,shadow)
  
6.  Investigate the cause of the build failure from the console output:

  ![Investigate](/images/mfe/project1consoleoutput.png?classes=border,shadow)
  
7.  Back in Cloud9, expand the "McAfeeAtRSA" folder and double click the "fixme_easy_cloudformation.json" file to open it in the Cloud9 code editor:

  ![Open Easy Cloudformation File](/images/mfe/openeasycloudform.png?classes=border,shadow)
  
8.  Using the information in the failed Jenkins build's console output, try to find and fix the problem within the CloudFormation template.  Feel free to use Google and AWS Documentation to assist with making the necessary changes! 

9.  When you are satisfied with your changes, save them ("File > Save") and then commit and push the changes to your repository.

10. Commit the code changes to your local copy of the code with the command ``git commit -a -m "Updated Security Configuration""`` and then push the changes to your repo by entering ``git push``

  ![Git commit and push](/images/mfe/gitcommitpush.png?classes=border,shadow)

  Note: This will trigger an automatic build of your new code in Jenkins within a few seconds.
  
11. Go back to Jenkins to see if the new build was successful.

12. If not, then investigate why it failed, try fix the issue check in the code changes again, and investigate the next build!

### When the build succeeds

1.  Investigate the console output from the build and see that this triggered a new VM to be deployed to Amazon EC2 based on an image (AMI). In the console log in Jenkins you can see the instance id and details about the newly deployed server.

2.  Navigate to the EC2 console in the relevant region 
  https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2
3.  Find the virtual machine and inspect the external IP and hostname

4.  Using your local browser, navigate to the URL/IP of this server using http (port 80) to see what your new server is now sharing with the world. E.g. http://ec2-18-144-85-51.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com

You can click on the System information links of the web server you deployed to see some details about the system and AWS status and metadata. All machines running in AWS EC2 can retrieve this metadata easily and it can be used to deploy and configure new workloads and elastic scalability pretty easily.

You can terminate the instance in the EC2 console or in the CloudFormation console.
