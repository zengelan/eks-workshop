## Wrapping up the Shift-Left lab

Shift-Left development models promise to speed up development efforts increasing product quality and revenue while decreasing costs.  However it lacks the human processes and gatekeepers to ensure security standard are met.  MVISION Cloud helps security organizations keep pace with development by automating what used to be manual processes.

In this lab we:

1.  Learned the basics of CI/CD pipeline automation
2.  Were introduced to popular tools such as Git, Jenkins, AWS CodeCommit, and AWS Code9.
3.  Learned how to integrate automatic security into CI/CD tools such as Jenkins.
4.  Sat in the shoes of a developer attempting to deploy and fix insecure infrastructure-as-code.

# GREAT WORK!
