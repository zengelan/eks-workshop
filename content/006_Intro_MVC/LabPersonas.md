# Lab Personas

#### Personas for this lab
This lab is designed for you to understand how AWS and McAfee work together to help secure your cloud environments as you take on modern IaaS annd PaaS infrastructure rollout. 

The lab takes into account that you may or may not have experience as a developer, devops or devsecops engineer. The lab should help you see how you can deploy apps and services while integrating cloud security in an integrated way. 

It is helpful to consider the challenges a developer or engineer may have when pushing software or infrastructure to a public cloud. Engineers and developers do not intentially put bad code or configurations into production! However, we often see that the security or compliance teams are unaware of what they are pushing to production; putting the organization at risk. 

Consider that having a tool like MVISION Cloud could facilitate prevention of these types of violations can be a major time saver as well as may keep the orginization safer overall. 

Today, you will be performing tasks typically completed by a developer, devops, or devsecops engineer.
