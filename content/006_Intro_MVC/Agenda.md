## What to expect

Fundamentally, MVISION Cloud will be connected to your AWS account to monitor DevSecOps and Developer workflows. 

The initial use-case is based upon managing cloud resources through Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPN). As you deploy resources into AWS, McAfee MVISION Cloud will check configuration against best practices and standards. 

The next use case concerns itself with sensitive data stored in AWS. Customers often do not have visibility into what kind of data lives in clouds. In this case, an S3 bucket is protected by MVISION Cloud 

Lastly, we will guide you through the "Shift Left" use-case. What if security principles were applied BEFORE a devops team pushed infrastructure? The scan results will show discrepancies that need to be remediated before being allowed to deploy to production. 

#### Labs Summary: 
- Lab 1: Cloud Security Scans
     - A configuration issue will need to be resolved. 
     - A data compliance issue will need to be resolved. 
- Lab 2:  CI/CD Developer Workflows - Protect insecure CloudFormation Templates
     - Learn about Jenkins CI/CD
     - Connect MVISION Cloud to Jenkins
     - Correct identified issues in CloudFormation Templates (easy, medium, hard)
